# genome_sweeps
This is the code repository for all figures in the paper "Genome-wide sweeps create fundamental ecological units in the human gut microbiome"

01_simulations contains all the code to simulate and test for the effective range of the recombination identification algorithm (Extended Data Fig. 2).
02_metagenome_clonal_frame contains the code used to call genome-wide sweeps (after the putative isolate-based sweeps have been identified using the PopCoGenomeS tool). It contains all the code to generate Figure 1, and Extended Figures 3, 4 and 5.
03_age_estimates contains the code used to estimate all the sweep ages (Figure 2).
04_recombination_rate_estimates contains the code to estimate recombination rates for each SGB (Figure 3, Supplementary Data Fig. 1).
05_ecological_associations contains the code to associate GWSSs and SGBs to the 5 host conditions of interest (Figure 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 7, 8).
06_functional_enrichments contains the code to find functional enrichments in genes that are unique to or are under positive selection in GWSSs (Figure 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9).
