compare_summary_SNP.R calculates the age of each sweep based on (maximum) pairwise distances between samples with 

1)a molecular clock of 1-10 SNPs per genome per year 
and
2) the metagenome-based molecular clocks generated from the UKtwins_analysis.R and longt_analysis.R.

Together, these form the basis for all the sweep age estimates in Figure 2.
